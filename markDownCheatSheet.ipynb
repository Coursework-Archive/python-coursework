    "##### Monalco Mining is one of the worlds largets iron companies in the world located in Western Australia. To accomodate high demand ore-crushers were purchased. Prior to purchasing the crushers the price per ton was 110 dollars, after the increase in market supply the price per ton decreased to 55 dollars leading Monalco to break even. Reducing the market price to 50 dollars per ton to keep market advantage is cutting it too close for comfort. With lower revenue and increased fixed cost in production the Marketing team at Monalco has decided to streamline costs including maintenance expenditure to limit the impact on business profitability.
