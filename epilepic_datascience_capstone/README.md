ML supervised learning classification model of epileptic seizure activity (23.5 s)

Two notebooks that contain exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and modeling 
for epileptic seziure recognition. One file that includes the seizure activity data,
Epileptic Seizure Recognition.csv. This is a classification study using four 
different classification models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, 
AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine). A comparison of three different evaluations of 
each classifier include confusion matrix of predicted labels and true lable for one
versus all. A performance measurement including area under the curve and receiver 
operating characteristics curve to assess the models performance. Last but not least 
a f1 score to show a different metric for performance.
