    "I believe the vaccine data and the covid cases will be sufficient to tackle the desired questions listed above. This is more of a documentation of the expanded program of immunization and how it compares to the public health records, rather than a business model. The target value that was identified in the project proposal was time dependent. The target suggests that there is potential for controlling the disease by 2022 and that people may go back to a normal way of life without masks, etc. There is some speculation about this, as well as skepticism, about the accuracy of predicting the eradication of a disease. There is far more information about the disease cases versus the vaccination. This is a fundamental difference that could not be corrected because this was a novel virus. The vaccines that were developed were barely approved within this dataset timespan. The information that is given for the vaccines could not be any greater. "

Comparing the total vaccinations column with the people vaccinated, there are values which are misaligned, and as we saw earlier, almost half of the data is missing from the people vaccinated column. From my understanding about the data this duplication of columns would lead to more questions than answers. Also, as mentioned before the daily vaccinations raw - was simply for data checks and transparency, most of the computation will be based off of daily vaccinations. Therefore, three columns will be removed: people vaccinated, people vaccinated per hundred and daily vaccination raw. "

The least documented vaccine was Sinopharm/Beijing, found in Morocco. Of the total 10 vaccines only half can be found in this graph sample population (Sputnik V, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinovac, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sinopharm/Beijing).
